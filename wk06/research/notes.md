# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: 2025-12-08 10:15
**Context**: Difficuly balancing work and home life, partially sighted.
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "The last time I used my to-do app was actually earlier today! I was trying to sort out a couple of things: work deadlines, preparing packed lunches for the kids, and scheduling an optician appointment. I wanted to make sure nothing slipped through the cracks. Because of my sight issue, I rely heavily on features like reminders that pop up with clear audio cues—it saves me from straining to read small text. It’s honestly a lifesaver for keeping everything on track. Being partially sighted means I struggle with small fonts, cluttered layouts, and poor contrast between text and background. For example, on good days I might squint to read something; on tougher days I rely entirely on screen readers to navigate. It makes features like voice commands, text-to-speech settings, and dark modes so important to me. Task management apps that offer these accessibility options let me stay independent and organised, which really matters when juggling work and family."

**Observations**:
- Difficulty balancing priorities
- Sight issues making it difficult to navigate certain interfaces
- Reliance on other apps

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `lack_of_default_accessibility`, `work-life_balance`

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "One of the most frustrating things about managing tasks is when apps aren’t fully accessible. For instance, I once needed to check off tasks on a list for an upcoming family trip. The app I was using didn’t have clear labels for buttons, and I couldn’t rely on my screen reader to navigate properly—it kept misinterpreting things or skipping elements. It felt like I was spending more time figuring out how the app worked than actually being productive. Honestly, when accessibility features are lacking, it adds unnecessary stress to an already busy life. Honestly, it was quite disheartening. That sense of helplessness when you’re trying to stay organised and the tool you rely on just doesn’t cooperate—it’s frustrating. I felt a bit defeated, like I was being excluded because of an oversight in design. It reminded me why accessibility feels more like a necessity than a luxury. But it also made me determined to seek out apps with better features or report issues, because I believe designers can do better when they get feedback."

**Observations**:
- Frustration with lack of accessibility
- Struggles with the manager is time consuming
- Feeling of exclusion

**Themes**: `lack_of_confidence`, `feeling_of_exclusion`, `stress`

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "Oh, yes, I have! A couple of months ago, I completely forgot about a work presentation because I accidentally archived the reminder on my to-do app instead of rescheduling it. It was due on a particularly hectic morning when I was focused on getting the kids ready for school. I ended up scrambling to piece things together last-minute, which was stressful and embarrassing. That's why I’m so careful now with features like snooze options for tasks—it’s a backup to stop me making simple mistakes like that. To work around that issue, I’ve started double-checking tasks and reminders before I archive or change anything in my app. I also look for apps with clear labels and undo options, so if I do make a mistake, I can fix it quickly. On top of that, I’ve set up recurring reminders for critical tasks, like work deadlines or doctors’ appointments, so they don’t slip through the net. Honestly, it’s made a big difference in staying calmer and more focused."

**Observations**:
- Missed reminder - high stess caused
- Heavy dependence on task manager app
- App mostly used for critical tasks

**Themes**: `busy_lifestyle`, `dependency`, `urgent_tasks`

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: "Yes, I've had some moments where I’ve had to work without a mouse—like on a train or when my laptop’s touchpad was acting up. It’s definitely a challenge, especially being partially sighted. Keyboard shortcuts become my best friend in those situations, and I depend much more on voice commands if the app supports them. Having simple, accessible navigation makes all the difference; without it, I’d find myself fumbling around or missing what I need to do. Working without a mouse or touchpad pushes me to rely heavily on apps that have robust keyboard navigation and shortcuts. For example, I’ll use tab and arrow keys to navigate menus or tasks, and accessibility-friendly apps make this smoother because their layouts are less cluttered and labels are clearer. Voice commands come in handy too, especially if I’m multitasking or need to make quick updates."

**Observations**:
- Reliance on keyboard
- Reliance on voice commands
- Needs for simple navigation without a mouse

**Themes**: `keyboard_nav`, `voice_commands`, `button_accessibility`

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "Yes, I’ve actually tried using a task manager in both of those situations! With my eyes closed—like when I use voice commands while cooking—I often struggle if the app has voice responses that aren’t clear or if options aren't easily accessible without touch navigation. In bright sunlight, glare and contrast issues can make it hard to read tasks, especially if the colours blend together or the app doesn’t offer a dark mode. To work around those challenges, I’ve tried to adapt by configuring my task manager apps with settings that suit tricky situations. For example, I set text to be larger and use high-contrast themes to counter glare in bright sunlight. As for managing tasks with my eyes closed, I make sure the app has strong voice navigation and accurate recognition of commands—I avoid apps that fail here!"

**Observations**:
- Lack of proper voice navigation in such conditions
- Difficulty seeing in bright sunlight
- Lack of proper touch naviagtion

**Themes**: `voice_commands`, `weather_obstacle`, `touch_navigation`

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "If I could add one feature, it would be a universal accessibility mode for task managers that automatically adjusts text size, contrast, and enables voice navigation based on user preferences or environment. It would take the guesswork out of customising settings and ensure apps are always easy to use, no matter the situation. A universal accessibility mode would make task management smoother for everyone, whether you’re partially sighted like me or just handling tasks in tricky conditions. Imagine an app that senses your environment—like bright sunlight—and tweaks settings automatically for easier use. It could offer enlarged font, adjust colour schemes, or optimise voice commands instantly. Having tools that adapt like this would save time and reduce stress. "

**Observations**:
- Manager that is able to observe the environment
- Automatic adjustments based on user preferences
- Automatic adjustments based on the environment

**Themes**: `automatic_observation`, `adjustments_for_user`, `adjustments_as_per_environment`

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Sight impairment → difficulty navigation dark interfaces
2. High dependence on task manager → failure to keep up causes high impact
3. Difficulty changing settings → high frustration and stress
4. Contrast issues in bright light → situational disability

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I am using a task manager app in bright sunlight, I want it to be able to adjust itself to appropriate settings for my situation."
- "When I work without a mouse, I want accessibilty friendly shortcuts to reduce my frustrations."
