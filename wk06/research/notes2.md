## Summary (Participant B)

1. Anxiety over workload → makes it difficult to get started on tasks
2. Lack of timeliness → missing important deadlines

**Job story ideas**:

- "When I have important deadlines coming up, I want to be able to keep track of them so that I don't receive any penalties because it will have a huge negative effect in me academically."
