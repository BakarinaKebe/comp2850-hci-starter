### Q1: Last time you used a task manager

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "Probably finding time to actually make a list using it. Like, sometimes you could be busy, like 'oh I'll just do it in the evening,' but I'm just like, 'it's evening time now, I want to relax.'"

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "No, I've always been mostly on time when it comes to deadlines. I don't think I've ever given in a late assignment. I've always kept track of my assignments to hand in. Mostly because with my course, if I don't hand something in on time, I don't get to do a resubmission."

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: I always use a mouse. I don't bring my laptop to campus anyway. I just bring a notepad and just write stuff down on it. But with my laptop, I always use a mouse. I don't bring my laptop to campus because it's too big to bring with me."

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "I don't remember ever using a task manager with my eyes closed. But I feel like using a task manager in bright lighting, it can be hard to see your phone or device. Becausew obviously there's a maximum seetting your phone can go up to for brightness, so it can be a struggle to see what you're doing. I don't really use my phone outside when it's bright, I just wait until I get home or I'd just use my hand to block the sunlight."

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "I guess different colours, like, not everything has to be one colour. Like tasks you input and complete, they can have different colour coordination, so it doesn't look like all blended up. Like, on Google Calendar, you can use different colour themes, but if it's one colour consistently, especially if it's like that all the way to the bottom of the list, it's just going to be like, 'what am I looking for?'"
