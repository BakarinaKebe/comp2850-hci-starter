## Participant C
**Date**: 2025-12-08 20:15
**Context**: Keepong track of priorites
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "I typically use it to make to-do lists for the week. Mostly for appointments or things that I have to do. So you know, like, I have a doctor's appointment, I put it in a list."

**Observations**:
- Need for a list to keep track of priorities
- Sounded very relaxed, inidcating that there is no issue with making these lists and keeping up with them

**Themes**: `organisation`, `time_management`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "Probably finding time to actually make a list using it. Like, sometimes you could be busy, like 'oh I'll just do it in the evening,' but I'm just like, 'it's evening time now, I want to relax.'"

**Observations**:
- Tends to procrastinate on making a list despite knowing that it's helpful
- Task of making a list seems so menial that there's no point in doing it

**Themes**: `procrastination`, `worth_the_effort`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "No, I've always been mostly on time when it comes to deadlines. I don't think I've ever given in a late assignment. I've always kept track of my assignments to hand in. Mostly because with my course, if I don't hand something in on time, I don't get to do a resubmission."

**Observations**:
- Anxiety surrounding submission penalties
- Pressure to submit work on time acts as a motivator
- 

**Themes**: `deadline_anxiety`, `motivation`

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: I always use a mouse. I don't bring my laptop to campus anyway. I just bring a notepad and just write stuff down on it. But with my laptop, I always use a mouse. I don't bring my laptop to campus because it's too big to bring with me."

**Observations**:
- Prioritises convenience above all else
- Avoids using a laptop where it won't be as easy to use

**Themes**: `avoidance`, `comfort`

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "I don't remember ever using a task manager with my eyes closed. But I feel like using a task manager in bright lighting, it can be hard to see your phone or device. Because obviously there's a maximum seetting your phone can go up to for brightness, so it can be a struggle to see what you're doing. I don't really use my phone outside when it's bright, I just wait until I get home or I'd just use my hand to block the sunlight."

**Observations**:
- Once again, avoids using a phone where it is not convenient
- Spoke very casually, indicating that this is not a common experience for them

**Themes**: `convenience`, `comfort`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "I guess different colours, like, not everything has to be one colour. Like tasks you input and complete, they can have different colour coordination, so it doesn't look like all blended up. Like, on Google Calendar, you can use different colour themes, but if it's one colour consistently, especially if it's like that all the way to the bottom of the list, it's just going to be like, 'what am I looking for?'"

**Observations**:
- Desires distinction between different tasks in the list
- Would like the process of looking for/creating a task to be quick and simple

**Themes**: `swiftness`, `simple_comprehension`

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Too inconvenient to not use a mouse → avoids using laptop where mouse isn't available
2. Taking time to make a list feels like too much effort → avoids making one altogether
3. Task manager does not offer coloured distinction between tasks → frustration with looking for a task

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I look for a task in a list, I want to not spend so much time looking for it so that I don't waste time because I need to get my tasks done quickly."
- "When I make the intention to make a to-do list, I want to not feel like it is a daunting task so that I don't procrastinate on doing them because these tasks are of high priority. "
